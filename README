Linux kernel "-arighi" for Samsung Galaxy S II (GT-I9100)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

=== DISCLAIMER ===

I take no responsibility for anything that may go wrong by you following these
instructions. Proceed at your own risk!

=== Requirements ===

- A Samsung Galaxy S II (not necessarily rooted! you'll get a root shell when
  you'll flash the new kernel)

- The latest android SDK

- The arm-none-eabi cross-compile toolchain (you can get it from the
  CodeSourcery website)

=== HOWTO ===

Download and install the arm toolchain from the CodeSourcery website: be sure
that arm-none-eabi-gcc is in your $PATH.

Get the autobuild script:
 $ git clone git://github.com/arighi/gt-i9100.git

Run the script:
 $ ./build-kernel.sh

The script will download all the "-arighi" kernel source code, a initramfs
template and it'll produces a new kernel ready to be flashed into the device.

The file is called: kernel-gt-i9100-arighi.tar This file can be flashed using Odin.

=== Additional notes ===

- All the custom *.ko files are included into the initramfs to avoid potential
  errors/problems with the original kernel modules (so it is always possible to
  flash back the original kernel later, all the old kernel modules are still
  there untouched).

- After you've flashed the -arighi kernel you also have root access to your
  device. The initramfs template enables adb root shell (ro.secure == 0), so an
  adb shell will immediately drop you to a root shell. This means you can also
  re-flash your device from Linux directly using the flash-kernel.sh script.

- For the complete list of all the patches applied to this kernel have a look
  at the git log here.

- IMPORTANT: the fsync-disable patch (enabled in the kernel) can increase
  performance and battery life, but it is dangerous!! It makes the software no
  longer crash safe, so if you start to randomly kill your apps you may lose
  some data.
